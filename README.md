# TAILS MacOS Command Line Installer

Following this guide you will be able to create a [TAILS](https://tails.boum.org/) image that will work on
most Apple Mac computers without requiring any REFIT or bootloader modifications to the target
system.

## Dependencies

In order to create a TAILS disk image on MacOS you will need the following
dependencies:

  * [gnupg](http://www.gnupg.org/download/)

  * [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

The easiest way to install these is with
[homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew):

```
brew install git gpg
```

If you want to build the EFI bootloader yourself you will also need:

  * [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)

  * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Setup TAILS OSX

```
git clone https://github.com/rmwb/tails-installer-macos-cli.git
cd tails-installer-macos-cli
```

## Create the EFI bootloader (optional)

You can build the EFI bootloader directly from the MacOS Terminal (given you have
installed vagrant and virtualbox) by running:

```
vagrant up
```

This is basically running this command from inside a linux box:

```
grub2-mkimage -d /usr/lib/grub2-efi/x86_64-efi/ -o BOOTX64.efi \
-O x86_64-efi --prefix /efi/boot part_gpt part_msdos lvm fat ext2 \
chain boot configfile normal minicmd linux reboot halt search \
gfxterm gfxmenu efi_gop efi_uga video loadbios gzio video_bochs \
video_cirrus echo true loadenv
```

## Build the image

```
./create-image.sh
```

You will be asked to select a volume that will be formatted and will contain
the TAILS live cd.

The script will then proceed to fetch TAILS, verify the signature, mount the
iso, move some files in the ISO over to the USB disk and then configure grub
properly.

Once you have finished this you will have a usb disk you can boot by holding
down the alt-option key at startup.

# TAILS official documentation

New versions of TAILS support UEFI bootloaders out of the box. This means that in the near future this procedure will no longer be needed.

If you would like to use their method for setting up TAILS instead of running this script you should follow their instructions at the following address:
